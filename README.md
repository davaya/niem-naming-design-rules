## Status

NDR 6.0 will be a complete rewrite of the previous NDR 5.0.  This rewrite is partially complete in the current draft, which is available for review as:

* HTML:  [ndr-v6.0-psd01.html](htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/blob/dev/ndr-v6.0-psd01.html)
* PDF:  [ndr-v6.0-psd01](ndr-v6.0-psd01.pdf) *not working yet*

## Generating NDR6

* NDR 6.0 is written in Markdown.  The source file edited by people is [ndr6src.md](ndr6src.md).
* An intermediate Markdown version is generated via Perl scripts, which
  * Transform defined terms in the text into links to definitions in the Glossary
  * [some appendix generation tbd]
* HTML is generated from the intermediate Markdown with [**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org)
* PDF is generated from the HTML with [**wkhtmltopdf**](https://wkhtmltopdf.org)
* This build automation is controlled by a [Makefile](Makefile).
